Though it is called a fort there are no such fortification or bastions to be seen on the top of the hill except for few cannons and rock cut cisterns. The fort was garrisoned by the Pratinidhi till it was taken by Bapu Gokhale of Peshwas in 1810. The fort was managed by Bapu Gokhale until it was surrendered to British Army headed by Colonel Hewiti without resistance.[1]
