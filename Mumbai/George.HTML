<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>Fort George was an extension to the fortified walls of Bombay (now Mumbai) built in 1769; it was in the present-day Fort area, to the east of the site of the former Dongri Fort. The hill on which the Dongri fort stood was razed, and in its place Fort George was built. In 1862, the fort was demolished.
    The fort was 1 mile (1.6 km) long and about one-third mile (500 m) wide. Its length ran from NNE to SSW, and it was named in honour of George III of the United Kingdom.
    George III (George William Frederick; 4 June 1738 â€“ 29 January 1820) was King of Great Britain and Ireland from 25 October 1760 until his death in 1820. The Acts of Union 1800 unified Great Britain and Ireland into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, with George as its king. He was concurrently Duke and Prince-elector of Hanover in the Holy Roman Empire before becoming King of Hanover on 12 October 1814. He was a monarch of the House of Hanover, who, unlike his two predecessors, was born in Great Britain, spoke English as his first language,[1] and never visited Hanover.
    n the later part of his life, George had recurrent and eventually permanent mental illness. The exact nature of the mental illness is not known definitively, but historians and medical experts have suggested that his symptoms and behaviour traits were consistent with bipolar disorder or porphyria. In 1810, George suffered a final relapse, and his eldest son, the Prince of Wales, was named Prince Regent the following year. The King died aged 81, at which time the Regent succeeded him as George IV. George III reigned during much of the Georgian and Regency eras. At the time of his death, he was the longest-lived and longest-reigning British monarch, having reigned for 59 years and 96 days; he remains the longest-lived and longest-reigning male monarch in British history.
