<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>The Worli Fort is a fort in Worli, Mumbai, India.[1] Though often incorrectly assumed to have been built by the Portuguese, the fort was built by the British around 1675 on Worli Hill. Worli Fort overlooked Mahim Bay at a time when the city comprised just seven islands and was used as a lookout for enemy ships.
    The centuries-old village is home to one of the oldest communities of fisherfolk which is still existing in Mumbai.[2]
The area around Worli Hill is also known for its fossils and geology[3]
The British built Worli Fort in Mumbai, India around 1675 on Worli Hill. The fort overlooks Mahim Bay and was used as a lookout for enemy ships and pirates when the city was made up of only seven islands. 
The fort is well-preserved and has a European style. It has a weight lifting room and offers good views of the sea link and the Bandra-Worli coast. The fort is free to visit and is easily accessible by any mode of transportation. However, it doesn't have a wheelchair accessible entrance or parking lot. 
Some say the fort offers a panoramic vista of the Bandra-Worli Sea Link, while others mention the beautiful sunset and marvelous view of the Arabian Sea.
