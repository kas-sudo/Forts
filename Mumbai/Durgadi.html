<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>Durgadi Fort is a fort located in Kalyan, near Mumbai in Maharashtra, India.
    The fort has a Hindu temple and a masjid at the top, which has religious significance for both Hindus and Muslims. It has witnessed riots in the past and is considered communally sensitive. A team of State Reserve Police Force personnel is deployed for security.[1]
    The fort's construction started during Shah Jahan's reign and was completed in Aurangzeb's reign in 1694 AD. Durgadi Fort is built on a hill beside the Kalyan creek. The fort came under Marathas when Shivaji captured Kalyan and Bhiwandi from Adilshah in 1654. Shivaji built the fort close to the creek and used it as a dock to build boats and ships. During British Raj, stones from the fort wall were used to construct the Kalyan and Thane piers.[2]
    Under the rule of Marathas, a new gate about 150 feet to the south of the Ganesh Gate was opened near the mansion of Maratha General Ramji Mahadev Biwalkar. In the citadel of the fort, Marathas built a small temple of Hindu goddess Durga and named the fort Durgadi in honor of the goddess, a name it still bears. The original idol of the goddess Durga was stolen in 1876.
    Shivaji used the fort as dock and began the work of the first Navy of Hindavi Swarajya and he hired 340 Portuguese artisans to build the naval docks. Later, the fort was repaired by Ramji Mahadev Biwalkar.
