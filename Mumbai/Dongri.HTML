<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>The Dongri Fort or the Dongri Hill Fort, locally known as the Janjire Dhavari Fort, is a fort in Mumbai, India.[1] It is located in the Dongri area. It came under Maratha rule in 1739. Since then the locals and the church have been looking after the maintenance of the Fort, which was once repaired. Every year, during the month of October, the feast of Our Lady of Fatima is celebrated there. Many People from far off villages come to offer their prayers there. One can take a 360 degree view of the surroundings from this fort, with the Arabian Sea at the West, the Vasai Fort at the North, the Borivali National Park at the East, and the Essel World and Water Kingdom at the South.
    The Dongri Fort, like other forts in Mumbai, is in a dilapidated condition. It was built by the the East India Company in the 17th century after evicting the original Koli inhabitants from the island. The Mumbadevi Temple of the Dongri Kolis has eventually given the city its name. The fort is in urgent need of restoration and has been classified as endangered by the Archaeological Survey of India.
    Dongri Fort, also known as Dungarwadi Fort, stands proudly atop a rocky promontory overlooking the Arabian Sea. Its strategic location along the Konkan coast made it a vital outpost for maritime trade and defense against coastal raids. Built during the Maratha era in the 17th century, the fort served as a key stronghold for the Maratha Empire, protecting their territorial interests and maritime trade routes.
    The construction of Dongri Fort is attributed to the Maratha warrior king, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, whose vision of a strong and unified Maharashtra drove the expansion of Maratha power along the coast. Under Shivaji's leadership, Dongri Fort was fortified with sturdy walls, bastions, and cannons, making it impregnable to enemy attacks. Its commanding vantage point offered unparalleled views of the surrounding sea, enabling the Marathas to monitor maritime activities and thwart any potential threats.
