<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>It was famously defended by Tai Telin a mistress of Pant Pratinidhi a killedar of the fort when he was captured.
    Vasota fort is attributed to the Kolhapur Shilahara Chief Bhoja II (1178–1193) of Panhala.[1] Vasota always remained with Marathas, Shirkes & Mores in 16th century.
    Shivaji incorporated the fort into the Maratha Empire in 1655 during the conquest of Javli. Shivaji renamed the fort "Vyaghragad" (Vyaghra – means tiger), owing to its difficult natural defense.
    In 1818 the British bombarded the fort with heavy artillery, destroying many buildings on Vasota (Chandika mandir, Daru-kothar, etc.) and looted property worth 5 lakhs.
    The fort is in dilapidated condition and is overgrown. The remnants of Shree Mahadev mandir and the plinth of a huge "sadar" (discussion place) are there.[2] It is a protected natural reserve.
    Vasota Fort is located about 70 km from satara near Bamnoli village on the banks of Shivsagar lake.
