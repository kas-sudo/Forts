<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>Mahimangad is expressly mentioned as one of the chain forts built by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj to guard his eastern frontier. But some of the local residents declare that the fort existed in Musalman times and point to the pir shrine as evidence. This shrine however proves nothing since there are many such unfortified hills with shrines. The masonry is characteristic of the later built forts of Maratha times consisting of small, almost or altogether, uncut stones bound by mortar usually poor but, at the bastions and entrance, of good sound quality. On the same spur about a hundred yards east of the fort is a hill which barely commands it and is connected with it by a neck of the spur. The hamlets at the feet are not walled or protected in any way so that the approach within 250 feet of the top must have been easy enough. To escalade it however must have; been difficult though at the south-east corner by no means impossible. The hereditary garrison consisted of about seventy-five Ramoshis and Mahars who held the gadkari inam lands. The fort had lands assigned for it. The havaldar or former commander of the garrison is now the patil and the sabnis or accountant is the Kulkarni of the lands which are for purposes of administration as a distinct village called by the name of the fort.
    The easiest way to it is by the Satara-Pandharpur road to a point about half a mile west of the pass descending into the lower parts of the Maan taluka. From this point a broad track branches off northwards to the fort which lies not more than half a mile from the road. There are three hamlets close on the north of the fort which towers about 250 feet above them. It consists of a flat nearly triangular table land with the apex to the east surmounting a perpendicular scarp of black trap below which are steep slopes of short grass with a little soil. The sides are overgrown in places with prickly pear especially on the north-west corner. The ascent should be made from the second hamlet which will be encountered on approaching the Pandharpur road from the north-west. A path about five feet wide with rude steps at intervals of almost every yard takes to the fort. A steep walk of about five minutes leads up to the gateway, the immediate approach to which is in places almost blocked by prickly pear. The path which leads up the side in a south-east direction here takes a turn at nearly right angles to the south-west. But before entering, </p>
