<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>Chandan Fort is located in Satara District. This fort is situated on a hilly spur from the main ridge of Sahyadri. This fort is frequently visited by trekkers and pilgrims. The villages at the base are rich in sugarcane and other cultivation. The Chandan and Vandan are adjacent forts. The trek to both the fort can easily be completed in a day.
    According to the evidence from the manuscripts found written on copper plates, the Chandan and Vandan forts were built by King Bhoj-II of Shilahar Dynasty in 1191-1192. King Shivaji won these forts from Adilshah of Bijapur in 1673. However, according to the latest studies published by Akhil, Maharashtra Itihas Parishad, and Bharat Itihas Sanshodhak Mandal, the first fort captured by Chatrapati Shivaji was Chandan after he took an oath at Raireshvar. An old temple of shiva in the Rohideshvar area in the village of Raireshvar. It was under the control of the Marathas until 1689, after which it passed in the hand of Moghuls. It was again won by the Marathas before 1695 and Aurangzeb had to fight again to recapture it in 1701. In 1707, it was finally captured by Chatrapati Shahu Maharaj
    The path to the fort passes through an open area devoid of any vegetation. This fort has a peculiar stone piled structure. The path on the fort passes between the piles. On the southern part of the fort are three rooms built-in stone without any roof. They are believed to be store rooms.
