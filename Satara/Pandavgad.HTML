<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>The fort is said to have been built by the Kolhapur Silahara chief Bhoja II. (1178â€“1193) of Panhala. About 1648 it is mentioned as being in the charge of a Bijapurmokasadar stationed at Wai. [Grant Duffs Marathas, Vol. I, 109.] In 1673 it was taken by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj [Grant Duffs Marathas, Vol. I, 202.]. In 1701 Pandavgad surrendered with Chandan Vandan to Aurangzeb's officers. [Grant Duffs Marathas, Vol. I, 303.]. In 1713 during his flight from Chandrasen Jadhav the Maratha captain or Senapati, Balaji Vishvanath afterwards the first Peshva, being refused shelter by the Sachiv's agent at Sasvad attempted to cross to Pandavgad in the opposite valley. Closely pursued, he contrived to conceal himself until two Marathas, Pilaji Jadhav and Dhumal, then common cavaliers in his service, gathered a small troop of horse and carried him with great difficulty to Pandavgad where he was protected by Shahu's orders. Chandrasen demanded that Balaji should be given up and in case of refusal threatened to renounce his allegiance. Shahu refused to give up Balaji and sent orders to Haibatrav NimbalkarSarlashkar then at Ahmadnagar to march on at once to Satara. Meanwhile, Balaji was in Pandavgad surrounded by Chandrasen's troops. But hearing of Haibatrav's arrival at Phaltan about forty miles east, Chandrasen quitted Pandavgad and marched to Deur about fifteen miles to the south-east [Grant Duffs Marathas, Vol. I, 323.]. During Trimbakji Dengle's insurrection in 1817 Pandavgad was taken by the insurgents. It surrendered in April 1818 to a detachment of the 9th Native Infantry Regiment under Major Thatcher [Bombay Courier, 18 April 1818
