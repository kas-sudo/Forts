<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>The Battle of Pratapgad between Shivaji and Afzal Khan, a general of Adil Shahi dynasty, was fought below the ramparts of this fort on 10 November 1659. This was the first major test of the fledgling kingdom's army, and set the stage of the establishment of the Maratha empire.
    Pratapgad continued to be involved in regional politics.[until when?] Sakharam Bapu Bokil, a well-known minister of Pune, was confined by his rival Nana Phadnis in Pratapgad in 1778. He was later moved from fort to fort until he died at Raigad. In 1796, Nana Phadnis, while escaping from the intrigues of Daulatrao Shinde and his minister Baloba, assembled a strong garrison in Pratapgad before heading to Mahad. In 1818, as part of the Third Anglo-Maratha War, Pratapgad was surrendered to the East India company.
    Pratapgad fort is located at 15 km (10 miles) from Poladpur and 23 km (15 miles) west of Mahabaleshwar, a popular hill station of Maharashtra. The fort stands 1080 metres (3543') above sea level and is built on a spur which overlooks the road between the villages of Par and Kinesvar.
    The fort has a Tulja Bhawani temple from Chhatrapati Shivaji's time. It have murti of goddess Bhawani, which have eight hands (Marathi : Ashtbhuja). Weapons of soldiers are on display near this temple
