<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>Ajinkyatara Fort, also known as the "Fort of the Sapta-Rishi," is a historical hill fort located on Ajinkyatara Mountain, one of the seven mountains surrounding the city of Satara in the Sahyadri Mountains of Maharashtra, India. Situated at an altitude of 3,300 feet, the fort overlooks Satara City and is considered one of the major heritage sites in Maharashtra
    Ajinkyatara Fort was built in the 16th century by Raja Bhoj of the Shilhara dynasty. Throughout its history, the fort witnessed several pivotal moments in Maratha history. In 1673 CE, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj took control of the fort from Adil Shah. Subsequently, between 1700 CE and 1706 CE, the fort was under the control of Mughal Emperor, Aurangzeb. In 1708 CE, Shahu Maharaj conquered Ajinkyatara, which remained with the Marathas until the British seized the fort in 1818 AD. Notably, Tarabai Raje Bhonsale captured the fort from the Mughals and renamed it Ajinkyatara. During the Mughal rule, the fort was known as Azamara.
    Ajinkyatara Fort is surrounded by 4-meter-high thick walls with bastions and features two gates. The main gate, located close to the northwest corner, is fortified with high buttresses, while the smaller gate is situated in the southeast corner. Inside the fort, there are several water tanks used for water storage. Visitors can explore the temples of Devi Mangalai, Lord Shankar, and Lord Hanuman, located on the northeast side of the fort.
