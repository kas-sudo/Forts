<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>The fort is rectangular in shape with two entrance gates. The gate towards the village is in good condition while that towards the river is in ruined state. There is a 5 feet tall Maruti/Hanuman statue inside the fort along with group of 5 temples which were constructed during Yadav period. The Hemadpanti architecture temples are of Baleshwar, Lakshmi-Narayan, Mallikarjun, Rameshwar and Bhairavnath. There are many heroic stones, Satigal, cannon balls, Deepmal and a statue of Shiva in front of the Bhairavnath temple.[1]
    Very little is known of the history of the fort. During the Mughal Empire, Pedgaon was one of the chief stores and a frontier post of the Moghul Army. In 1672, the then Deccan Viceroy, Khan Jahan, camped here and tried to pursue the Maratha army headed by Shivaji I. Khan Jahan built water channels in order to bring water from the river Bhima. The Mot and the Persian wheel are well preserved till now. Khan Jahan renamed Pedgaon as Bahadurgad. This fort was captured by Shivaji by fooling the Moghul Chief. There is a 2 storied palace of Aurangzeb inside the fort. It is believed that Sambhaji met Aurangzeb in this palace. In 1759 Pedgaon was captured by Sadashivrao Bhau Peshwa, and remained with the Marathas till 1818.[2]
