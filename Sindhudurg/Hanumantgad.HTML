<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>Hanumantgad (Marathi: हनुमंतगड) is a fort located 24 km from Sawantwadi, Sindhudurg district, of Maharashtra. The fort is situated on plateau at the top of the hill.
    The fort was built by Fond Sawants of Sawantwadi for protection from Portuguese and Kolhapur rulers.[1] IN 1838 this fort was captured by British Army. Aatmo Chuker and his colleagues tried to capture this fort but, failed due to internal rivalry.[2]
    The nearest town is Banda which is 13 km from Sawantwadi. The base village of the fort is Fukeri which is 16 km from Banda. There are good hotels at Banda, now tea and snacks are also available in small hotels on the way. The Fukeri village is well connected by motorable road. The trekking path starts from the hillock north of the Fukeri. The trek route passes through dense forest and the ascent is very steep. It takes about an hour to reach the top of the fort. The night stay on the fort is not possible.
    The fort walls are in demolished condition. The entrance gate on the southern side is in good condition but lay half buried in soil. There are two bastions and few rock cut cisterns on the fort. In the Fukeri village there are two metal cannons with manufactured year 1783 engraved upon them.[3]
