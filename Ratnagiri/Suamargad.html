<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>Sumargad is a less-visited fort in the Ratnagiri district. This fort lies east of the Khed. It is about 19 kilometres (12 mi) from Khed City. There are no human settlements around the fort. There are two ways to reach Sumargad; one from Mahipatgad and the other from Rasalgad.[1] The trek to this fort is through remote forest area. Very little history is known about this fort.
    The fort has steep cliffs on all sides. It is a very small fort, with fortification over an area of 1â€“2 acres. There are many rock-cut water cisterns on the fort. Only two cisterns have clear potable water. There is a cave on the fort with Shivalinga. From the top of the fort Mahipatgad, Rasalgad, Chakdev and Parvatgad can be seen.
    The fort is located in the middle of hill range that spans in the North South direction and runs parallel to the Sahyadris. Due to its difficulty in access, height and tough climb only experience mountain trekkers can reach at this fort. It has straight rock surfaces on all the sides of the fort and the way to the fort requires some rock climbing to reach to the fort which is located on the summit. There are some water cisterns on the fort. In one of the cistern there is a Shivalinga and idol of goddesses Bhairibhavani, Zolai, Vaghjai and Navlai in one cave. The fort provides views of Sahyadri forts in the east which includes forts of Vasota and Makarandgad. In the west one can see mid Sahyadri or Valati forts of Palgad and Mandangad.
