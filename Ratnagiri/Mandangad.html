<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>Mandangad Fort (also called Chitradurga Fort)[1] is about 2 km from Mandangad town in Ratnagiri District, Maharashtra. This fort is said to be constructed by King Bhoj.[2] After the Mughals lost the Battle of Umberkhind , This fort was captured by Shivaji in the battle with Adil Shah. A 400-year-old cannon is the major feature of the fort. The fort constitutes a Ganapati Temple and a tank called Thorla Talav.
    It consists of three separate fortifications - Mandangad proper to the south, Parkot in the middle while Jamba in the north. The Jamba water reservoir is now dry. Even though they are believed be much older, local legend attributes Mandangad to Shivaji, Parkot to Habshi of the Siddis and Jamba to Kanhoji Angre(also called Angria). All three forts were captured in 1818 by Col. Kennedy
    Mandangad is a Taluka place in Ratnagiri district. Overlooking the small town of Mandangad is a two peaked hill fort also known by the same name i.e Mandangad. Mandangad fort is has quite an obscure existence and doesnâ€™t find much of a mention in history books. In fact, it is one of the very old forts in the region with data suggesting that Mandangad was built in 12th century during the reins of the Shilahar dynasty.
    v (Thorla means Bigger in Marathi), a recently renovated Ganesh temple standing next to the Throla Talav, a Darga, a magazine, tanks, few ruins of bastions and remains of fort walls are the only structures that one can see atop Mandangad. However, the recently renovated Ganesh temple stands majestically on the small hump near the Lake is a beautiful place to stay, if one wishes to stay on the fort. From the southern end bastion, one can sight the hill fort of Palgad standing opposite to Mandangad.
The history of this fort is very much speculative and obscure.
 water is not available on the fort. Carry your own stock.
