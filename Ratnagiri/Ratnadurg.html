<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>Ratnagiri Fort, also called Ratnadurg Fort or Bhagawati Fort, is a fort located 2 km from Ratnagiri, in Ratnagiri district, of Maharashtra. This fort is an important fort in Ratnagiri district. The fort is a main tourist attraction due to the Bhagawati Temple inside the fort.
    This fort was built during the Bahamani period. In 1670 Maratha King Shivaji won the fort from the hands of Adil Shah of Bijapur.[1] King Shivaji had built protecting towers on two commanding points, one at the south and the other near the old court house. The Citadel defense was improved by maratha admiral Kanhoji Angre in 1750–1755. Dhondu Bhaskar Pratinidhi did some minor repairs to the fort during Peshwa regime (1755–1818).[2] The fort was later won by the British in 1818. The temple of Bhagavati was renovated in 1950.
