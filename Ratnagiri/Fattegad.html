<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>Fattegad is a fort located 15 km from Dapoli, in the Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra. It is one of three forts built to guard the Suvarnadurg fort; the other two are Goa fort and Kanakdurg.
    The fort was built by Khairiyat Khan during the Shivaji era. This fort was under the control of Tulaji Angre. Due to the rivalry between Peshwa and Tulaji, a combined efforts were made by British and the Peshwa against Tulaji. The fort was captured by Captain James and handed over to Peshwas. In 1817, British forces captured the fort from the Peshwas
    The nearest town is Dapoli. The fort is at walkable distance from the Harne town. A wide motorable road leads to the entrance gate of the fort. It takes about half an hour to have a walk around the fort
    The fort is in a dilapidated state. The only parts of the fort left standing are the walls and the bridge joining with Kanakdurg.
