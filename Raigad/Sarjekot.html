<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>Sarjekot Fort (Marathi: सर्जेकोट)is an old military fortification in India. it is situated very close to the Malvan.[1][2] It is located in the Arabian Sea close to the Malvan town in Sindhudurg District of Maharashtra state.
    The history is similar to the Kolaba fort. This fort was built on the rocks to secure the strategic positionThis fort is 26mtX27mt in dimension. There are five bastions and stone wall encircling the fort.. the entrance is facing the Kolaba fort. There is a well inside the fort.
    Marathas built a fort on Khanderi island in the sea of Alibaug and left the island of Undheri unused. In 1671, the Siddi of Janjira captured Undheri and built a fort on it which proved to be a smart move against the Marathas. Sambhaji Maharaj might have deduced the same danger for Kolaba and Sarjekot forts and decided to build a causeway to join them.
    It has been traced from one of the edicts of Shivaji Maharaj that he had ordered to build a fort on the shore and if required flatten the hilly terrain or build the fort on top of it. The main aim was to arrest the permeability of the area from enemies. It is suspected that Sambhaji maharaj built the fort on the rock adjoining the Kolaba fort taking into consideration the above edict.
