<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>It was one of the forts which was captured by Malik Ahmad Nizam Shah I of Ahmednagar in his konkan campaigns in 1485.[2] Shivaji Maharaj gave 2000 hones (golden coin used as currency during Shivaji Maharaj's time) for repairing the fortifications of this fort.[3] After the victory over Vasai, Chimaji Appa donated a Portuguese bell to the Ballleshwar temple which he had brought from Vasai in 1739.[2] Till independence, this fort was in Bhor princely state
    Among the Ashtavinayakas, Ballaleshwar at Pali is the only Ganesha who is famous by the name of his devotee and who is dressed up as a Brahmin. This place is nestled between the fort Sarasgad and Amba River.Sarasgad fort is situated near village Pali in the Raigad district of Maharashtra. Pali lies about 10 kilometres East of Nagothane along the Nagothane-Khopoli road. This fort height from sea level is 490 meters
    On the top is the Shiva temple providing an excellent panoramic view of all the mountain ranges surrounding this area. Sudhagad, Sankshi fort, Sagargad and TailBaila can be easily viewed from the top of Sarasgad. There are many caves that were used for soldiers and other purposes because the fort has the very little area available on its top. There are around ten tanks carved in rocks. They provide cool water supply throughout the year, which is very important for any fort
