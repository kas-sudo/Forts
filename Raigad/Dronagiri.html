<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>The fort was under the rule of Yadav of Devgiri. In 1530, the fort was repaired by the Portuguese. In 1535, the father Antono-de-porto constructed three churches Nosa senhora, N.S.Da Penha and Sam Francisco.[1] In the 16th century the fort was captured by Adilshah and was in his control for some period. Finally it passed to the hand of British. On 10 March 1739, the fort was captured by Manaji Angre along with the Uran (Daurnagar) fort
    The ruins of the fortification are seen on the fort. There is a church Nossa Senhora da Penha in good condition, but without any idol or inscription. There are two water tanks "Gagoni and Gijoni" near the church. The church is in the inner fortification. The main gate to the fort is situated on the south of the church 50 m away. The arch of the gate is broken, yet the guards rooms are in good condition. The Ganpati carved on the key stone is placed in one of the guard room. From the main gate a path way leads south to the Village Karanja. In between a Vetal mandir in ruined state is located. The pathway starting from the back of the Vetal mandie leads to large water tank in good condition situated among the forest. The ONGC plant is well overlooked from the fort, however photography of the plant is not allowed.
