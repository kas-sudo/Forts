<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>The Kurdugad Fort is also known as Vishramgad Fort. It was named after the goddess Krudai Devi whose temple is constructed at the base of the fort. The fort was constructed during the reign of Shivaji with the assistance of Sardar Baji Pasalkar. The Peshawas were in control of the Kurdugad Fort but it lost its importance once the British rule had begun. The fort was later brought in light by Dattoba Pasalkar, a descendant of Baji Pasalkar.
