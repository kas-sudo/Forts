<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>Little history is known about the fort. The locals say that it is not a fort but a sort of lighthouse from where the directions were given to know the advancements of the enemy through the Ganapati Ghat road. It can be called a watch tower to keep a vigil on the Mawal area in the greater province of the Maratha. Records say that this fort along with Tungi fort was constructed by Aurangjeb while capturing the Kothaligad Fort
    Padargad is a small fort used for vigilance in the past. is situated to the east of Karjat in the Indian state of Maharashtra. It is on the Bhimashanker trek route in the Karjat area, because of its height and difficult climbing, it is not visited by most of the trekkers.    There is a large cave and few dried up water cut cisterns on the fort. The narrow pinnacle is called Kalavantins pinnacle.
    Two differently sized pinnacles is the distinct feature of this trek. There is a plain flat land between them. The top of the fort gives astounding views of the nearby mountains. Siddhagad, Kothaligad and Bhimashankar top are clearly visible from the top. There is a big room on the left side of the bigger pinnacle.
    The Padargad Fort trek lies just beyond the Bhimashankar Wildlife Sanctuary. The locals call this fort ‘Kalavanticha Mahal’ due to its 2 rock pinnacles. It stands tall at 2202 feet (671 meters) above sea level. The fort is in complete ruins and is very small in size. One can find a few water cisterns and caves on Padargad trek route.
