<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>It is not known about who built this fort. In the 16th century, this fort was under the control of Adilshah of Bijapur. King Shivaji won this fort in 1648.[1] This fort was encircled by troops of Siddhi of Janjira when Afzalkhan had tried to kill Shivaji Mahraj at Pratapgad, However, Shivaji Maharaj killed Afzalkhan and knowing this Siddhi also returned with the troops to Janjira. At times this fort was in control of Siddhi, Angre and Maratha rule. Finally, Col. Prother captured this fort in 1818
    Ghosalegad Fort is located 8  km south of the Roha town on Roha-Bhalgaon-Murud road. This fort is in form of a narrow strip 20mt in width. This fort has a small hill with a narrow spur guarded by fortification. This fort served to keep watch on the enemy and the trade route from Maval to the sea ports around
    The long fortification around the narrow strip of Machi is in good condition. There are caves and rock-cut water cisterns around the Balekilla hill. There is an escape gate which connects the narrow wall of fortification. There are two idols of Sharabh laying near the main gate. The toilet block on the fortification is also seen. There is cannon on the western side of balekilla.
