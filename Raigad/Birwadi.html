<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>In 1648, this fort was built by Shivaji Maharaj, along with Lingana fort, after capturing Kalyan. This fort was used to keep watch on the Revdanda creek and to check the activities of Siddhi.
    Birwadi fort (Marathi: बिरवाडी किल्ला) is hill fortress located in the village of Birwadi in Roha taluka, Raigad district, Maharashtra, India. Birwadi village is about 3 km away from Chanera village, which is on the Roha–Salav road. The fort looks like a small hillock from a distance.
    Birwadi fort is connected by road to the village Chanera. State buses and Rickshaw are available to reach Chanera from Roha. The way to the fort is from the back of the Newly constructed Devi temple. It takes about 45 minutes to reach the top of the fort.
    There are four corner bastions and the main gate in good condition. There are many stone cut water cisterns on the fort. Two cannons are now moved to the temple at the base of the fort. The view from the summit is pleasing with rice-fields and dense pockets of the jungle around.
    The night halt can either be made in the Govt. school in the village or in the Devi temple.
