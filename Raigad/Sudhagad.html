<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>The origin of this fort is said to date back to the 2nd century B.C.,[2][unreliable source?] the same age as the Thanale Caves and Khadsamble caves nearby. It was then called Bhorapgad[3] (after its presiding deity, Bhoraidevi). In 1436, it was captured by the Bahamani Sultan. In 1657, the Marathas took over and renamed it "Sudhagad"(the sweet one). It was a large fort and Sudhagad was considered by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj as the capital of his kingdom. He surveyed it, but instead chose Raigad because of its central location
    In the regime of the Peshwas, the ‘Pantsachivas’ of Bhor[4] became the custodians of this fort. After the annexation of princely states in 1950 the fort became patron less. As a result, the fort is in a state of ruins, even though it escaped the wrath of the British.
    Sudhagad / Bhorapgad is a hill fort situated in Maharashtra, India. It lies about 53 kilometres (33 mi) west of Pune, 26 kilometres (16 mi) south of Lonavla and 11 kilometres (6.8 mi) east of Pali in Raigad District. The summit is 620 metres (2,030 ft) above sea level.[1] The entire area around the fort is declared a Sudhagad wildlife sanctuary.
    The first fort has several ruins of two temples dedicated to Lord Shiva. However, the temple of Bhoraidevi (its patron goddess) is well maintained temple.[4] On the large plateau at the summit,[5] there are two lakes, a house, a big granary, some tombs, a shrine (Vrindavan) and numerous other ruins, scattered around the fort area. There are three main gates the largest of which is called the Maha Darwaja.[4] From the top, other forts like Sarasgad, Korigad, Ghangad, Taila-Baila are clearly visible.
