<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>Tungi fort (Marathi: तुंगी किल्ला) is a small 16th-century fort probably mainly used as a lookout post in the past. It is situated to the east of Karjat in the Indian state of Maharashtra. It is one of the easy-to-reach forts near the Bhimashanker trek route in the Karjat area.
    Little history about this fort is known. The locals say that this is not actually a fort but a lookout station from where any movement of troops along the Ganapati Ghat road could be seen
    The base village is Khandas which is 31 km from Karjat. Karjat is well connected by road and railway from Mumbai and Pune. The starting point for the trek is Khandas village. The path to the south of the village leads to the fort
    some of the forts in the sahyadri region have lost their recongnition in history leading to some confusion
    regarding their names and loaction
