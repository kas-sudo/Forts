<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>There is a series of steps leading to the top of the pinnacle, but little is known about the history of the structure. According to local guides, it was built for a queen called Kalavantin in the 15th century, around the same time as the neighboring Prabalgad
    In Marathi language the word "Durg" means fort. Although it is called "Kalavantin Durg", there is no fort. Kalavantin is a pinnacle which was used by the ruler to have watch on surrounding area.
    Kalavantin Durg is a 2,250 ft (686 m) high summit located in the Western Ghats, near the Prabalgad fort in the Raigad district of Maharashtra, India. It is also known as Kelve Teen, Kalavantinicha Sulka, or Kalavantin Pinnacle; alternative transliterations include Kalawantin, Kalavati, and Kalavanti. It is a popular trekking destination
    Steps leading up to the fort have been cut into the rock face of the hill. From the peak of this hillfort you can see Matheran hill, Chanderi, Peb, Ershal, and Karnala forts and also Mumbai city. â€‹On every Holi (Shimga) Festival, the Adivasi People of Machi-Prabal village observe the custom of dancing at the top of Kalavantin fort. These people have a long-standing relationship with this fort and it has become a part of their heritage.
