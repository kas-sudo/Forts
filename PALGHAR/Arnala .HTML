<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>In 1530, the Portuguese constructed a bastion (Martello tower) on the island, strategically located at the mouth of the Vaitarna river. In the 1530s the Portuguese had established their operations in the coastal area, headquartered at Fort Bassein, and soon gained control of the island. The Portuguese captain of Bassein donated the island to a Portuguese nobleman who began construction of a 700-by-700-foot (210 m Ã— 210 m) fort. The nobleman never completed the fort. Still, it remained under Portuguese control for two centuries; they used it to control shipping and navigation along the northern Konkan coast.
    During the late 17th and early 18th centuries, after a long struggle with the Mughal Empire, the Maratha Confederacy came to dominate the region. In 1737, the then Peshwa Baji Rao I sent his brother, Chimaji Appa, to take the Bassein Fort from the Portuguese. After winning the Battle of Vasai, his general, Shankarji Pant, persuaded Chimaji to launch an assault on Arnala island, for its strategic importance to the Maratha navy in assaulting Portuguese interests. Their first assault, coordinated with a Maratha naval force commanded by Govindji Kasar & Manaji Agre, was routed by a superior Portuguese naval force. A second assault on the fort on 28 March 1737, caught the Portuguese by surprise, and forced them to abandon the island. Peshwa Bajirao I then ordered Shankaraji to build a new fort on the island. The fort has 10 bastions and there is only one currently standing. On the forts northern entrance there is a plaque or Shilalekh, containing information about the building of the fort. The bastion constructed by the Portuguese still stands on the West end of the island.
    The British captured the fort on 18 January 1781, during the First Anglo-Maratha War.[3] The Treaty of Salbai nominally returned the Arnala and Bassien forts to the Marathas. The Marathas controlled the fort until 1817.
Today the fort is in a state of disrepair.[4]
Arnala Fort is built on a small island off the port town of Arnala, located around 13 km (8 miles) north of Bassein, Maharashtra, India.[1] Being an island fort, it is also called Jaldurg or Janjire-Arnala. The Marathas who build the present fort called it Janjire Arnala.[2]
