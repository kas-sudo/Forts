<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>Bhupatgad Fort is a fort in Palghar district in the Jawhar taluka in Maharashtra state of India.
    The fort is located about 130 km from Thane. The nearest town is Jawhar. This fort lay about 30 km East of the Jawhar town on northern spur of hills that run east from Jawhar. The Fort is situated near the villages Kurlod and Zaap.
    This fort can be reached after an easy trek of one hour from the base village Kurlod or Zaap. There are no proper fortifications or bastions left on the fort except for two entrance gates in ruined state . There are few rock cut water cisterns and statues of Mhasoba and Hanuman on the fort.[1]
    Very less history of this fort is known. This fort was important to keep watch over the Trimbak-Wada trade route. This fort was in the Jawhar princely state till 1947.
    There are 2 doors, one is from north and one is from south but both of them are in very bad condition. Infact the whole fort is not in a good state. As you enter the fort you can see a Mahsobaâ€™s statue along with a statue of Hanuman. Bhupatgad has a very large plateau. You can still see some of the fortification which is left.
Some ruined structures of palace can still be seen. Behind these ruined structures there are water tanks. You need nearly half an hour to see the entire fort. From Bhupatgad, areas like Tringalwadi, Harihar, Trambakeshwar, Jawhar, and Mokhada can be seen.
