<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>Tandulwadi Fort is located near Saphale, 104 km north of Mumbai. Tandulwadi is not a fully built up fort, but a series of structures spread over the top of the mountain. The fort dates back 800 years and was primarily used as a watch tower over the surrounding plains. At a height of 1524 feet, it has views of the surrounding towns of Saphale, the Zanzorli lake, and the confluence of the Surya and Vaitarna rivers.
    The fort is located near Lalthane village in Palghar district, about 104 km from Mumbai, 75 km from Thane and 7.5 km from Saphale railway station. It is also reachable through the Mumbai - Ahmedabad Highway NH 8. Upon reaching Varai Phata you have to take a left turn after crossing the bridge over Vaitarna river.

    The first known history of the fort was in the 15th century (about 1429) during the rule of Jafar Khan, son of Ahmed Shah of the Gujarat Sultanate. It was used as a reconnoiter fort to keep a watch on neighboring forts and the Arabian Sea. In 1454, the Sultan of Ahmedabad captured Mahikavati (Mahim) and one of his Sardar named Mallik Allauddin was made chief of Tandulwadi fort. In 1509, the Portuguese took the fort after they wrested Diu from the Gujarat and established a stronghold at the nearby Vasai area, where they built the Vasai Fort. The Portuguese lost control of the area to the Marathas in 1737 after the battle of Bassein.[1]
