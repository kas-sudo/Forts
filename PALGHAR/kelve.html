The half of the fort is below the sandy beach level. The fort is located in the Mangelwada of Kelve village. There is a small Kelve pankot on the mouth of the Kelve creek.
    This fort was built by Portuguese. The Portuguese reported that in 1727 there was a garrison of sixty men in the fort out of which seven were white. There were 15 guns of two to ten pounder size but there were no artillerymen. Most of the guns were unserviceable.[1] After the siege of Vasai Fort by Chimaji Appa, the Maratha army captured this fort on 10 January 1739. The fort was captured by British Army in 1818. The half buried fort in the sandy soil was unearthed in 2008–09.[2]
