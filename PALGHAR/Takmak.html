<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>Takmak Fort is located in Palghar taluka of Palghar district in Maharashtra. The fort is situated on a north-south hill spur ending in a steep rise. The fort is in a ruined state with few remains of fortification. This is a fort located 60 km (37 mi) from the city of Mumbai. For some time, this fort was in the possession of the Portuguese and it was captured by Maratha army after the Battle of Vasai in 1739. It was captured by British Army in 1817.
    The fort was built in the 12th century by King Bheemdev, son of King Bhimdev. Later on, the fort was conquered by the Sultans. King Shivaji might have won this fort along with Kohaj & Asheri (Which remains an assumption till date). After King Shivaji, fort went under Portuguese supervision. Takmak fort received importance after Chimaji Appa’s Vasai campaign. Maratha warrior won Takmak fort in 1732 from Portuguese. But as per the agreement between Maratha & Portuguese, the fort went into Portuguese custody. On 8th April 1737, Pantaji Moreshwar won this fort from Portuguese. For the provision of funds, 25 villages had been allocated amongst his men. After Vasai Mohim, the importance of Takmak fort has lessened. In the 18th century, the fort was used as a jail by the British government. While demolishing the hill & cisterns on the fort, necessary care has been taken so that fort can’t be restructured
