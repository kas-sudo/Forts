<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>Kohoj is a medieval military fortification located near Palghar in Palghar district in Maharashtra, India.
    Kohoj is located about 104 km from Mumbai off the Mumbai - Ahmedabad Highway. Upon reaching Manor you have to take a right turn under a newly built flyover and take the Manor - Wada road. It is approximately around 10 km from the right turn. A few minutes drive on this road and one can see the Kohoj fort on your right. At the bottom of the fort is a lake known as 'Pazhar'.
    The fort is said to be about 800 years old and finds a mention in the Purandar treaty along with 22 other forts which were surrendered by Shivaji Maharaj to the Mughals on 11 June 1665. It was also an important fort for keeping a look on the nearby coast and thus to keep the territory safe and secure.
    Access to Kohoj Fort is via the main trek trail at which breaks from the Kohoj Fort road near the Saltwater lake on the Wada-Manor road. On reaching the plateau of the fort, a temple of Lord Shankar can be seen, which has now been rehabilitated. There were ten rock cut cisterns on the fort [1] Two cisterns can be seen in front of the temple. One of the routes descends from the left side of the temple, where seven adjoined cisterns are located. One of the cisterns bears clean water. The other two cisterns have been spoiled, the remaining four being clogged. Few remnants in dilapidated state can be seen to the right of the temple. Fortification is also seen at some of the places on the fort. The other way stretches from the right side of the temple up the hill. Three large cisterns can be seen on this route, one of which is clogged and the other two contain water. This water can be used for drinking. An idol of Lord Hanumana can be seen near these cisterns.[2]
