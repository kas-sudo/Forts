<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>Bhavangad Fort (Marathi: भवानगड किल्ला, Hindi: भवानगड क़िला, transliteration: Bhavа̄ngad Killa) is a fort located at Saphale - Madhukar Nagar 3 km from village Kelve, in Palghar district, of Maharashtra. This fort is in very dilapidated condition. The outer walls, steps, parapets, bastions etc. were built without using limestone at many places. This fort was built to by Shrimant Chimaji Appa Peshave to capture the Fort Bassein by Maratha Army.
    The Fort is in a dilapidated state. Few remains of the bastion, fort walls, and the water cistern are seen on the fort. There is a temple of Bhavangadeshwar temple on the highest point on the fort. It takes about an hour to walk around the parapet wall and visit all the places of the fort.
    This fort was built by Shrimant Chimaji Appa Peshave to check the atrocities by Portuguese. This fort was built in 1737, with the help of 2000 laborers. This fort played a prominent role in the conquest of the fort Bassein.[1] This fort was captured by British in 1818.
    Bhavangad is built on small hill. Within 10 minutes we will enter through main entrance on Machi. Since the fort was to be built in less time, the walls were built by just setting the rocks and no cementing material like lime was used. We can see renovated temple of Bhavangadeshwar on fort.
    The western entrance of citadel is of Gomukhi style. The arch of this entrance is broken, but the bastion and the walls are intact. Limestone was used in construction of this entrance. Beside entrance, there are vestibules for guards. Inside there is a square water tank, around which the locals have built a protective wall. It is full of water.
    Citadel area is full of trees. Start from the fortification on the right of tank. Small path goes down from North-East of fortification. On left of path there are 2 caves. They were probably used to store grains. This path goes to Dandapada village. Just return from caves, and complete the fort visit.
