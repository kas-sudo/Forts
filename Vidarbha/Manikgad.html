<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>Manikgad / (also called Gadchandur) (Marathi: माणिकगड / गडचांदूर) is an ancient fort in Chandrapur district, Maharashtra. It is a hill fort 507 metres above sea level built by the Naga kings in 9 CE.[1] The fort is in ruins and is frequented by wild animals that live in the vicinity, such as panthers and boars. Several monuments of historical importance are nearby.[2]
    Manikgad was built by the last Mana Naga King - Gahilu. The Mana Nagas settled in this area around 9 CE. Initially, the fort was named Manikagad after the patron deity of the Mana Nagas - Manikadevi - but later on this was shortened to Manikgad.
    Local legend holds that the fort was built by a Gond king named Mankyal (hence the name Manikgad). However, the lintel of the entrance gate has a Naga image carved in relief and not the Gond emblem of a lion and an elephant. So this legend is likely not true.[2]
    The fort was built of large black stones and was a formidable defense in its time. Rampart walls of the fort enclose a valley that has ruins of old buildings and store-houses. Outlines of apartments are visible against the rampart walls. The southern bastion, along with its supporting wall, collapsed.
