<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>Narnala Fort or Narnala Qila Sarkar, also known as Shahnoor Fort, is a hill fortress in the Satpura Range of Vidarbh, Maharashtra, India, named after the Rajput Solanki Chaulukya Ruler, Raja Narnal Singh, also known as Narnal Singh Swami. It was renamed as "Shahnoor" by Islamic rulers but again acquired, rebuilt and got its name "Narnala" by ruler Rao Rana Narnal Singh Solanki, who migrated from Patan in Gujarat.[1]
    Briefly, the fort was first established in around 10th century A.D. by Gavli Kings and major fortifications were made by Narnal Singh Swami and some by Rao Rana Narnal Singh Solanki, like the Mahakali Gate. It was then taken over by other Islamic rulers. In the mid 15th century, it was occupied and rebuilt by the Mughals, becoming one of Berar Subah's thirteen sarkar. The fort was captured and fortified by Gond kings during the 16th century. Later, in the late 17th century, it was under Maratha Empire, controlled by Bhonsle of Nagpur Kingdom and their reliable regent and Sardar, earlier the ruler of Narnala, the Solanki Rajput Qiledar family of Rao Rana mentioned above.
    Raja Narnal Singh or Narnal Singh Swami was a scion of Chalukya ruler, on whose name the fort is named. The fort was ruled by several rulers and qiledars after him thus making a lot of changes in the original Rajput style. After him, his descendant from the north & descendant of the ruling family of Rao Raja of Rajasthan came to this fort.
