<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>Sitabuldi Fort (Marathi: सीताबर्डी किल्ला), site of the Battle of Sitabuldi in 1817, is located atop a hillock in central Nagpur, in the Indian state of Maharashtra. The fort was built by the British after they won this area. Mudhoji II Senasaheb Subha was allowed to continue ruling Nagpur after the British had won the battles of Sitaburdi, Sakkardara, and Nagpur. Richard Jenkins entered into a treaty with Mudhoji on 6 January 1818, which was later ratified by the Governor General. Article 7 of the treaty stated: "The two hills of Seetabuldee with the bazaars and land adjoining, to a distance to be hereafter specified, shall be henceforth included in the British boundary, and such Military works erected as may be deemed necessary." By this treaty, the British occupied the Sitaburdi hills and large areas on all four sides. However no major construction work was erected on it for next two years.[1] The area surrounding the hillock, now known as Sitabuldi, is an important commercial hub for Nagpur.[2] To the south is Nagpur Railway Station and behind it is Tekdi Ganapati, a temple of Ganesha.[3] The fort was a home to the Indian Army's 118th infantry battalion (Territorial Army) Grenadiers till 2019.[4][5]
    Sitabuldi Fort, a major tourist attraction in Nagpur, is situated on two hillocks: Badi Tekri, literally meaning 'big hill', and Choti Tekri, meaning 'small hill' in Hindi. The Sitabuldi hills, though then barren and rocky, were not entirely unoccupied. Tradition holds that Sitabuldi got its name from two Yadava brothers – Shitlaprasad and Badriprasad Gawali, who ruled the area in the 17th century. The place came to be known as "Shitlabadri", which during British rule became "Seetabuldee", and later assumed its current form, "Sitabardi" or "Sitabuldi". The Battle of Sitabuldi was fought in November 1817 on these hillocks between the forces of Appa Saheb Bhonsle of Nagpur and the British.
    During the 18th and 19th centuries, the Marathas tried to overcome the gradual supremacy of the East India Company, while the British prepared to suppress the Marathas. At the beginning of the 19th century, during the Second Anglo-Maratha War, the victorious British annexed territories of the Marathas.
