<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>Indori fort was built by Sarsenapati Khandojirao Yesajirao Dabhade in the year 1720–21.[2] The fort also has a mint building inside the fort which is in a dilapidated state. The widow of Khanderao (Khandojirao), Sarsenapati Umabai Dabhade, was the first and only woman to become Commander-in-Chief of the Maratha forces in 1732. Their daughter Savitribai Dabhade married Srimant Yeshwantrao Mande (Sardar or equivalent of Earl), a descendent of Moropant Trimbak Pingle, the first Peshwa of the Maratha Empire, serving on Shivaji Maharaj's Ashta Pradhan (Council of Eight Ministers).
    Induri Fort is also famous as the 'Sarsenapati Dabhade Gaadi' (seat of power) at Induri in 1720–21. The Samadhi of Sarsenapati Khanderao Dabhade is situated at the Shrimant Sarsenapati Dabhade Baneshwar Mandir in Talegaon Dabhade. The current Srimant is Abhishek Mande Bhot, who ascended upon the 'Gaadi' in 1990 upon turning 15
