<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>The fort originated during the Satavahana era. Every entry point on the forts built by Shivaji Maharaj have a 'Kalas' and Lord Ganesh carved on it. The nearby Naneghat (Toll collection booth) was used for commercial purpose by traders to help in easy movements of goods. As this was an important pass joining the seas to the mainland, it was heavily guarded from enemies. The Jivdhan fort stood as an important guard fort to protect the interests of various kingdoms. The last emperor of Adilshahi of Ahmednagar was little Murtaza. He was kept as a prisoner by the Mughals at Jivdhan fort. In 1635 the father of Shivaji, Shahaji released him from the prison and declared him a King of Ahmednagar.[citation needed] Jivdhan to Naneghat has an open field of 2â€“3 km, which gives any clear indication of enemy approach.
    In 1818 the fort was captured by Col. Prother of the East India Company and later destroyed parts of the fort.</p>
    Jivdhan is a part of the 'Famous 5' trekking destinations among trekking enthusiasts. Chavaand, Hadsar, Shivneri, and Naneghat are the other destinations in the Famous 5 trek. This is a high difficulty grade trek due to the misleading jungle tracks and the necessity and knowledge of using climbing equipment. The rock cut steps are wonderfully carved, which lead to the kalyan gate. There are hooks attached on the walls of the rock cut steps near kalyan gate, which makes it easy for regular climber.
It is said[by whom?] that the boy king Murtaza Nizam Shah III, last nominal ruler of Nizamshahi, was held by Shah Jahan on this fort. Shahaji maharaj rescued the boy king because he had promised that while he was alive, nothing would happen to the boy.
