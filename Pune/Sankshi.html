<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>Sankshi Fort सांक्शी किल्ला This fort is located in Pen Taluka of Raigad district of Maharashtra. It is 9 kilometres (5.6 mi) from Pen
    A Sank[1] king built the fort. He had a daughter named Jagamata. The king was killed in battle, his daughter committed suicide by jumping from the fort; this is the popular myth. In 1540 Nizamshah of Ahmednagar captured this fort from Gujarath's sultan. The Sultan of Gujarat captured it back with the help of Portuguese. Later he assumed the Nizam were counter-attacking the fort, so he handed over the fort to the Portuguese and ran away to Gujarat. Due to frequent attacks on the army by the Nizam, the Portuguese purchased the fort along with Karnala fort from Nizam.
    There are no Bastions or Gate on the fort. But there are plenty of rock cut cisterns on the fort and a small cave. Climbing the fort is through rugged, rough rocky boulders.[2] The Badruddin Darga at the base of the fort is worth visiting. There is a water cistern called Gajishah tank on the way to the top.[3] From the top of this fort many forts like Karnala, Manikgad and Sagargad are seen.
