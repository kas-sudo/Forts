<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>Dhak Bahiri is a cave in the Sahyadri hill range, situated near the village Jambhivli off village-Malavali in the Pune district of India. It was used by pilgrims and sages for the pilgrimage to the god Bahiri.
    The nearest col to the cave sits at the end of a 1-hour hike along a trail leading out of Jambhivli. From there, the terrain rises into the Dhak and Kalakrai peak. Reaching the cave requires ascending the col and walking along the scarp, followed by a 30' vertical ascent.
    Water from the rock face drains into a cistern in the cave. There is room inside for 15 - 20 people to camp overnight. The local village maintains a supply of utensils and cookware on hand for use by campers
    Dhak Bahiri is a cave dedicated to Lord Bhairava situated near the village Jambhivli off village-Malavali in Pune district of Maharashtra. Afterwards, when Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj visited these caves for pilgrimage purposes, the Dhak fort was constructed. Centuries later, the fort is in ruin and a few water cistern inside the caves, are its only remnants. The Kalakrai pinnacle midway on the trek route is a great rock precipice that offers the best vista of everything below. However, without advanced mountaineering gears this particular trek is not recommended, even for the pros.
