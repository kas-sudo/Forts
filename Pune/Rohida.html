<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>This fort was built during Yadava period. According to the inscription on the third gate, Mohammed Adil Shah of Bijapur had repaired this fort on May 1656.
    Rohida was among the 23 forts Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj handed over to Mughals (to Aurangzeb) during the Treaty of Purandar(1665). On 24 June 1670, this fort was again captured by Shivaji Maharaj. Kanhoji Jedhe had patronage over the entire Bhor state and half of the Rohida Fort along with some patches of land. The Mughals captured the fort later on. This fort was under the control of Pantsachiv of Bhor State, until Indian independence
    There are three gates on the main entrance path of the fort. The main entrance gate has a Ganesh patti and Miharab. There is a rock cut water cistern near the second gate. The water is available round the year for drinking purpose. There are idols of Lion and Sharabha on the second gate. After climbing 57 steps the third gate is reached. There are idols of heads of elephants on either side and rock cut inscripture in Persian and Marathi on the outer side of the gate. There is a temple of Rohidamalla in good condition on the fort. There are seven Bastions on the fort, they are Shirawale Buruj, Patane buruj, Damugade buruj, Waghjai Buruj, Fatte Buruj and Sadar buruj. In some books presence of Shirja buruj is also mentioned, but its location is unknown.[3] There is a series of rock-cut water cisterns on the southern side of the fort. It takes about an hour to visit all places on the fort.
