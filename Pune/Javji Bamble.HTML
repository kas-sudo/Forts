<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>The Javjirao Hirajirao Bamble also known as Jivaji Bamble was a Koli Mansabdar of Rajur in the Maratha Empire, was the Deshmukh of 60 villages and chief of the Bamble clan. His family had been Vassals since the time of the Bahmani Sultanate.[1] After the death of his father Hiraji Bamble, he succeeded his father.
    In 1760, Javji Bamble revolted against the Peshwa Madhavrao. The reason for the rebellion was Javji Bamble was not given his father's fief and title, due to which Javji took up arms against the Peshwa, and shook the peace of Ahmednagar
    Javji started plundering the area under the Peshwa, after which the Peshwa wanted to compromise, citing Javaji and asking him to stop the rebellion happening in the Konkan region. He refused because he had no faith in the Peshwa, and went to Khandesh. So the Peshwa arrested Bamble's family and sent the Maratha Army to capture Javji. Subedar Ramji Sabant, heading the Maratha army, captured three of Javji's kolis, including a cousin Javji had sent to see to the well-being of his family. After that Javji killed Ramji Sabant's brother. Ramji Sabant sought reinforcements from the Peshwa and began a search for Javji. In spite of his large army, Ramji could not catch him, and was killed along with one of his sons, and this greatly shook the Peshwa. After this, the Peshwa made Sabant's elder son Subedar but he also was killed by Javji, in Junnar. After this, the Maratha government declared Koli Javji a dacoit.[3]
