<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>Shrivardhan Fort is one of the two hill forts that constitute the Rajmachi fortification, the other being Manaranjan Fort.[1] It is located in Rajmachi village which 8.5 km from Lonavala in the Sahyadris mountain range. At 900 m(3000 feet) above sea level it was the taller of the two peaks and was named after Shrivardhan Ganpatrao Patwardhan. Other than a rampart there is no visible construction. It was probably used at a watchtower for the Sahyadri region. There are two water tanks at the top of the hill but one of them has an iron pillar in it.
    There are two ways to reach the fort 1) Lonavla Tungarli way. It is an easy path which takes about 1 hour to reach the base village Udhewadi 2) Karjat-kondivade way. It requires a trekking up the hill for 2-hour. This route passes through dense forest area through the Ulhas river valley.
    It would be recommended to trek for some time to reach the Shrivardhan Fort. The trek to the fort follows a path that consists of half stone-paved steps and half rocky terrain. En route, a small ancient cave collects fresh and sweet water during the monsoon season, offering a refreshing respite.
Along the way, there is an ancient Kalbhairav temple with intriguing elements like an old cannon and early human-like paintings engraved on stone.
What makes the trek unique is the open path, free from dense forests or towering trees hindering the view. Each step takes you higher, revealing an unfolding picturesque valley below.
Upon reaching the fort, you can find stone water tanks, likely used by city guards for storing water. Inside the fort's premises is also a Shivling bound by small stone walls. It would have been a place of worship for the stationed guards.
