<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>Manaranjan fort is one of the two hill forts that constitute the Rajmachi fortification, the other being Shrivardhan Fort.[1] It is located in Rajmachi village which 8.5 km from Lonavala in the Sahyadris mountain range. Manaranjan fort is 2700 feet high which makes it lower than the neighbouring Shreevardhan fort. It has three gates and large ramparts. From here Karnala fort can be seen.[2] There are some water tanks at the summit.

It was one of the many forts he captured during his efforts to establish the Maratha Empire. -Defense System: Shivaji Maharaj strengthened the fort's defenses, recognizing its strategic importance in protecting the Maratha territories from invading forces. 3.Peshwa Era Administratio: During the Peshwa period, the fort continued to serve as a military stronghold and administrative center. The Peshwas were prime ministers in the Maratha Empire, and they maintained and used several forts, including Manaranjan, for governance and defense. 4British Colonial Period Capture by the British: The fort, along with others in the region, eventually fell to the British East India Company in the early 19th century during their campaign to conquer the Maratha territories. -Decline: Post its capture, the fort saw a decline in its strategic importance. The British focused on other, more accessible forts and military outposts.Architectural Features -Ramparts and Bastions: Manaranjan Fort boasts robust ramparts and several bastions, reflecting typical Maratha military architecture designed to withstand sieges and attacks. -Water Tanks: There are several water tanks within the fort precincts, which were essential for sustaining the garrison stationed there.
