<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>Mohangad Fort is a ruined hill fort in Pune district, Maharashtra, India, also known as Jaslodgad. It is located at Shirgaon, near Hirdoshi village, on the road between Bhor and Mahad. The fort was described as long deserted in a letter of 1659 from Shivaji I. The existing remains include rock-cut and dressed stone steps and several rock-cut water cisterns.[1] This fort was rebuilt by Bajiprabhu Deshpande as per instructions from Shivaji (after defeating ruler - Bandal on Rohida fort)
    Mohangad Fort, also known as Mohangad or Mohangarh, is situated in the Sahyadri mountain range. • The fort stands at an elevation of about 3100 feet above sea level, offering a strategic vantage point and panoramic views of the surrounding region. 2. Historical Significance: • The fort was built during the period of the Maratha Empire, which was known for its network of hill forts used for defense and administration. • It played a role in the military strategies of the Marathas, providing a defensive stronghold and a lookout point to monitor enemy movements.
    Like many forts in the region, Mohangad Fort was associated with the Maratha rulers, particularly Shivaji Maharaj, who established several forts throughout Maharashtra to consolidate and protect his empire. • The fort’s strategic importance lay in its ability to control and defend the routes through the Western Ghats.
