<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>In 1760 the fort were probably ceded by the Moghuls to the Peshwa along with many other forts in the Nashik region. In 1818 Kulang along with the other nearby forts were captured by the British forces.[3] The British, however did not destroy the steps of this fort
    Kulang fort (कुलंग गड ) is located in the Igatpuri area of Nashik district, on the western side of the Kalsubai hill range. This fort is adjacent to the Madangad and Alang forts, all of which were constructed to protect the Nashik-Kalyan ancient commercial road.
    There are few rock cut cisterns and a cave on the fort. There is no significant construction on the fort, except for a Wada made from stone masonry and the ruined main gate. The pathway to the fort is made of rock cut steps. From the top of this fort Kalsubai peak, Patta, Aundha, Madangad Fort, Alang Fort and Ratangad forts are easily visiblehere is no fuel wood on the fort, so it is preferable to carry fuel wood or a gas-stove from the base village
