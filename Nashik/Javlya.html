<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>The fort was positioned to overlook the trade route from Khandesh to Nashik. The twin forts are also named as "Rola-Jola" forts. In 1636 this fort was won by Alavardikhan for the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan. In 1670 this fort was won by Shivaji Maharaj. In 1671 Dilerkhan encircled the fort with Moghul Army but, was defeated. However, MahabatKhan captured this fort. This fort was under the Peshwas for a long time until the British forces captured it in 1818.[1] In 1819 Captain Mackintosh destroyed the steps, bastion and the walls of the fort making the ascent of the fort impracticable
    There are regular buses from Nashik to Wani. The cole ahead of the base village Babapur can be reached easily by bus. It takes about 5 hours to see both the forts.[citation needed]
    Javlya Fort (Marathi: जवळ्या किल्ला, Hindi: जवल्या किला, transliteration: Javalya Qilа̄) is located 43 km from Nashik, Nashik district, of Maharashtra. Ravlya fort and Javlya fort are twin forts located on a single hill plateau, Ravlya on the west and Javlya on the east side of the hill plateau
    The greater part of the fort is enclosed by wall with a single gate with Ganesh idol. There are rock-cut water cisterns, an inscription at the gate to be seen on the fort.
