<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>The Jain caves located at the foothills of the fort, spanning two levels. On the lower level there are two caves, neither of which has idols. On the upper level, there are five caves which feature Mahavir idols in good condition. They are secured by lock and key at night to avoid vandalism. There are carvings of Yaksha, Indrani, lotus and Lord Mahavir in the main cave. the fort at the base of the fort depict that Ankai was constructed around 1000 years ago. The fort was built by Yadava of Devgiri. Mughals led by Shah Jahan's General Khan Khanan captured this fort in 1635 by bribing the fort commander. In 1665, Th√©venot mentions these forts as a stage on the journey between the cities of Surat and Aurangabad.[3] Ankai was ultimately captured by the Moghals. In 1752, the fort came under control of the Maratha empire after the Treaty of Bhalki. It was subsequently captured by the British in 1818.
    Ankai Fort is a historic site found in the Satmala Range hills in western India.[1][2] It is located in Yeola Taluka of Nashik district in the state of Maharashtra. The fort was built by Yadava of Devgiri. Geographically, it is near Manmad. The Ankai fort and Tankai fort are two different forts on adjacent hills. A common fortification is constructed to secure both. The Ankai fort is located on a hill with perpendicular scarps on all the sides, except for a narrow nose on the eastern side.
    The Palace and Kashi Pond On the western edge of the plateau is a large palace in a dilapidated condition. Only the walls of the palace remain. Among the rock cut cisterns on the way to the palace is the Kashi pond, with a holy Tulsi pot engraved in rock placed in the center of the pond.
