The fort was built by Yadava of Devgiri. Geographically, it is near Manmad. The Ankai fort and Tankai fort are two different forts on adjacent hills. A common fortification is constructed to secure both. The Ankai fort is located on a hill with perpendicular scarps on all the sides, except for a narrow nose on the eastern side

On the upper level, there are five caves which feature Mahavir idols in good condition. They are secured by lock and key at night to avoid vandalism. There are carvings of Yaksha, Indrani, lotus and Lord Mahavir in the main cave. the fort at the base of the fort depict that Ankai was constructed around 1000 years ago. The fort was built by Yadava of Devgiri. Mughals led by Shah Jahan's General Khan Khanan captured this fort in 1635 by bribing the fort commander. In 1665, Th√©venot mentions these forts as a stage on the journey between the cities of Surat and Aurangabad.[3] Ankai was ultimately captured by the Moghals. In 1752, the fort came under control of the Maratha empire after the Treaty of Bhalki. It was subsequently captured by the British in 1818
