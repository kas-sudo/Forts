<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>Bahula fort is located in the Igatpuri taluka of Nashik district. It is located on the ancient trade route passing through Thal ghat. The fort is located near village Gulane
    The village Gaulane is located 37km from Igatpuri. Igatpuri is located on Mumbai-Nashik Railway route as well as National Highway NH 160. The fort is about 4km from the base village. It takes about one hour to reach the scarp of the hill. There are 70 rock cut steps which encircle the hill and lead to the top of the fort. There are few ruins of buildings and a water cistern at the top.
    In 1818 Captain Briggs of the East India Company captured the fort. In 1944 this fort along with adjoining area was handed over to Indian Military which they use regularly as firing range.
    A frail wall ran round part of the fort. The top of the fort was very small and had a ruined arched building like a bomb-proof. There was plenty of water, and, at the foot of the scarp outside the fort, was a fine excavation in the rock which served as a granary.
Presently the fort is in possession of the Indian Army where firing practices are conducted.
