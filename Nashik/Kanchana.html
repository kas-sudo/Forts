<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>Kanchana Fort is a hill fort in the Nashik district of Maharashtra. The fort is located in the Ajantha-Saatmal Mountain range.[1] The height of the hill in which the fort is located is 1368m or 4490 ft. Kalwan is the name of the village where the hill is situated
    When Captain Briggs visited the fort there were seven of the Peshva's militia in the fort.
Kachna was one of the seventeen strong places that surrendered to the British after the fall of Trimbak in 1818.
The fortification on the hill-top is also lying amidst ruins.
There is, however, plenty of water and the rock-cut rooms which must have served as granaries are now frequented by cattle
