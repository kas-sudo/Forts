<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>Ramsej or Ramshej Fort is a small fort located 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) north-west of Nashik, in the Indian state of Maharashtra. The fort is located on the Nashik-Vapi route.
    This fort was under the control of the Marathas under Shambhaji who valiantly resisted the army of Aurangzeb for more than 6.5 years.
As per mythology, Lord Ram during his exile is believed to have stayed & rested here before moving on to Panchavati. Hence the name Ramshej that literally translates as bedstead of Ram.
To conquer this fort Aurangzeb sent Shahbuddin Gaziudin Firozejung with an army of 40,000 soldiers and canons. The Mughals sieged the fort when the fort had only 600 Mavalas. The first attack came from the Mughals to which the Mavalas replied by a massive stone attack. As a result of this attack, the Mughals had to back off.
Afterwards Shahbuddin tightened the siege, dynamited the area and installed wooden platforms to hold the canons and many more ideas followed. The Killedar (commander) of Ramshej fort was an experienced and intelligent strategist and put an end to their daydreams.
Shahbuddin’s obstinate desire to win made him think carefully. “He made a wooden bastion capable enough to accommodate 500 men and 50 canons. Accordingly the surrounding forest was cleared to construct a huge wooden bastion. The Mughals attempted attacks from the bastion, which failed eventually
