<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>Madangad is a fort in the Nashik region of Maharashtra, India in the Kalsubai range.
    Another way towards fort is from Ghatghar. Go via Ghoti-Bhandardara. From there, in 2Â½ hours, one can come to the third cavern. Via Bhandardara from Udadvade. Another way towards the fort is via Bhandardara from Udadvade gaon. From here you reach till a plateau and then there are two routes to go to Madan. On first and mostly taken route, climb the Alang fort on the left and descend down via rappelling 80 ft rock patch on the other side of fort to reach common ridge point. Though this is difficult route, it is preferred to visit the Alang on day one, stay there at night and to do Madan trek on the second day by descending. Second route is reach directly to the common ridge point for Madan and Alang, keeping Alang fort wall on the left.
    Unlike Alang Fort, the top of the fort is a relatively small and tilted plateau. On the fort, there are a cave and 2 water cisterns. There are no man-made structures, building remnants over the fort. Alang, Kalasubai, Aundha Fort, Patta and Bitangad are to the east of the fort; Harihar, Trymbakgad and Anjaneri to its north; Harishchandragad, Aajobagad, Khutta (pinnacle), Ratangad and Katrabai to its south; and Kulang to the west.
    You have to climb the rock path of around 40 ft with the help of ropes, harness, carabiners etc. It might take 30 minutes to 1 hour to set up the ropes and get whole group up. This is the thrilling part of the trek. Since Madan has only one route to climb and descend, same patch you will have to descend
