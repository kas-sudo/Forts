<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>Tringalwadi fort is located in the Igatpuri taluka of Nashik district. It is located on the ancient trade route passing through Thal ghat. The fort is located near village Tringalwadi. The Tringalwadi irrigation dam which is close to the village was built in 1978.
    The presence of the caves indicate that the caves and the fort might be constructed around 10th century. The fort was built to overlook the trade route which connected Konkan to Nashik area. In 1636 the Shahaji (father of king Shivaji) had to cede it to the Moghuls after the defeat at mahulifort. It is not known when king Shivaji took control of this fort, but in 1688 this fort was won by Moghuls.[2] It is one of the 16 forts which was surrendered to British in 1818 after the fall of Trymbakgad fort
    There is an idol of veer Hanuman or maruti near the entrance gate and two sharabhaidols carved on the top of the entrance gate. On the fort are ruins of old buildings and a small Bhavanimata temple. There is a cave and a rock cut water cistern on the western side of the hillock on the fort.
    At the foothills of the fort is a Jain Cave Temple with a beautifully carved entrance and a stone idol of the first Jain Tirthankara Rishabhanatha in the garbha gruha. The cave has a large sabha mandapa. the western entrance to the fort is a unique structure of architecture. The steps and the entrance gate are carved from a single rock.
