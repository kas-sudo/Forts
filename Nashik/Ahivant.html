<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>In 1636 this fort was under the control of Adilshah. The Moghul Emperor Shahjahan sent one of his generals, Shaista Khan, and instructed him to win all the forts in Nashik region. Alivardi Khan was a cavalier of Shaista Khan who won the fort. In 1670, the Maratha King Shivaji won the fort from the Moghuls. The Mughal Emperor, Aurangzeb, sent his chieftain Mahabat Khan to win the fort. Mahabat Khan and Diler Khan opened a battle front from either side of the fort. The attack was so fierce that the fort was surrendered to Moghuls. In 1818, the fort was captured by British Colonel Prother.
