<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>Harihar fort / Harshagad is a fort located 40 km from Nashik City, 48 km from Igatpuri, 40 km from Ghoti in Nashik district, of Maharashtra, India. It is an important fort in Nashik district, and was constructed to look upon the trade route through Gonda Ghat. It receives many visitors because of its peculiar rock-cut steps.
    Harihar fort was built during the Seuna (Yadava) dynasty period. It was surrendered to Khan Zamam in 1636 along with Trymbak and other Pune forts.[1] The fort was captured by Captain Briggs[2] in 1818 along with 17 other forts.
    There are two base villages of the fort, Harshewadi and Nirgudpada. The Harshewadi is 13 km from Trymbakeshwar. The other base village of the fort is Nirgudpada/Kotamvadi which is 40 km from Ghoti which itself is 48 km from Nashik and 121 km from Mumbai
    There are no good structures left on the fort except for a storage house with a small entrance. There is a series of 8 rock-cut water cisterns in the centre of the fort. It takes about an hour to visit all places on the fort.[4] The fort gives a good view of Basgad, Brahmagiri , Kapdya, Brahma hill & Feni. Along with the famous vertical stairs there are another set of stairs leading to a secret entrance
