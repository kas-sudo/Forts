<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>The fort was located in the Bahmani Sultanate. In 1490, when the Bahamani Empire was divided, the fort was taken over by Nizam of Ahmednagar. In 1627, it was conquered by the Mughals. In 1671, Moropant Pingale seized the fort, but the Mughals retook it again in 1672. In 1675, the fort was taken over by Moropant Pingale.
    Patta was once at the border of the Swarajya. Shivaji arrived at this fort in November 1679 after fleeing the battle at Jalnapur. The Mughal army trapped him on three sides.[1] Thanks to Bahirji Naik, a spy and military commander, Shivaji was able to reach Patta safely.
    On 11 January 1688, the fort was occupied by the Mughul army headed by Matabar Khan. He appointed Govindsingh of Bhagur as the fort's chief. Peshwas later seized the fort in 1761. In 1818, the fort was conquered by the British army
    Patta Fort is straightforward to climb. During the full moon (Poornima), the disciples of Laxmangiri gather at these caves. The 'Ambarkhana' is a large, newly reconstructed hall which can accommodate about 200 visitors for overnight stays.
