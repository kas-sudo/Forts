<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>The history of the fort is similar to the Achala and Ahivant forts.It seems that this fort was aloof from the battles or events that happened in the past
    Mohandar Fort / Shidaka fort is a fort located 55 km from Nashik, in Nashik district, of Maharashtra, India. This fort is an important fort in Nashik district. The three forts Achala, Ahivant, and Mohandar are very close by. This fort was constructed to guard the Ahivant fort. This fort can be seen from a long distance due to the presence of needle hole in the cliff below this fort.
    The Ahivant fort is occupied on a large flat triangular plateau. All the structures are in ruined state. The ruins of store houses can be seen on the fort. There are some three rock cut water cisterns and foundation of the Kiledar residence on the fort to be seen.[3] There is a large pond in the middle of the fort. It takes about half an hour to encircle the fort
